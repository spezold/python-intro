# Python in a Nutshell
## A (very) brief introduction for Matlab users

### What?

This repository contains a very brief introduction to Python.

### Who?

The introduction was written for the students of the Biomedical Engineeing master's program at the Department of Biomedical Engineering (DBE), University of Basel. It is targeted towards people that have basic programming knowledge (specifically in Matlab).

### How?

The introduction consists of interactive Jupyter notebooks that can be launched via the *launch binder* badge above. Alternatively,
the repository can be cloned and launched locally. Dependencies are listed in `environment.yml`.

### What else?

The sample image *python.png* is a rescaled, cropped, grayscale version of [*Ltshears*'s image "Angolian Python - Python anchietae"](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Angolian-Python.jpg), which the author released into the Public Domain.
